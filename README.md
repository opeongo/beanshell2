This is a fork of Beanshell2, as of versions [v2.1.9+](https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2/tree/v2.1).
Please see [that version](https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2) for the project history.  
It appears that development of that project has ceased 
and effort is now going towards the [Beanshell 3 project](https://github.com/beanshell).  Check there to 
see what is going on.


Branch [2.1_sps of this repository](https://github.com/opeongo/beanshell2/tree/v2.1_sps) contains the 
latest 2.1.9+ release plus a few patches to improve error messages, 
better support the JSR 223 script engine interface, and to provide support for scripting inner class
that have parameters.
